      <P>
Edits of all the teens, Shawn, Belle, Chloe, Philip, Mimi, Jan and Jason from Days of our Lives. The edits also include Brady, Kevin, Susan, Cynthia, Penelope etc once the characters are introduced.
 <p>
I currently have two sets of edits available. The first are brand new which I am making on DVD from original tapes and DVDs (these are ongoing). You'll find all the information about these on this page.<p>
The other set of edits were originally made on video tape in PAL format and cover from mid 2000 - July 2001. See <a href="originalteenedits.html">Original Teen Edits</a> for more information on these.<p>
<hr><p>
The first edit continues directly on from the fourth <a href="shelle.html">Shawn and Belle</a> DVD. The start of the first teen edit DVD below is only Shawn and Belle (the same as Shelle DVD 5).<p> The full teen edits start from November 24th which is Chloe's first appearance. This means that from the 24th onwards it also includes scenes with the old Philip (Brandon Tyler). I haven't included his earlier scenes as part of the teen edits since a lot of them are included as part of the <a href="shelle.html">Shelle edits</a>. If you want to see his other scenes without Shawn/Belle in them, I do have these as full episodes.<p>
<p>For edits #1 through #64 the edits were recorded to DVD in the highest quality mode (each DVD runs for one hour) and from #65 onwards each DVD lasts two hours. I changed the quality mode due to the amount of DVDs, however the picture quality difference is negligable. 
The DVDs are all in NTSC mode (playable worldwide).<p>From DVD #39 onwards, all the edits are also available in Pal format.

<i>Sorry but due to the amount of time it takes, I don't intend on writing descriptions or adding screencaps for these teen edits.</i> <p>
However, they are made from the same tapes/DVDs as the <a href="shelle.html">Shelle</a> and <a href="phloe.html">Phloe</a> edits, so please check out these for an idea of quality/storylines and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
