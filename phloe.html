At the bus station, a man grabs hold of Chloe and tells her she's coming with him. He shows her a police badge but she claims it's a fake and threatens to scream. Instead of getting on her bus to New York, Chloe visits Nancy at the hospital. Chloe starts singing Silent Night and Nancy wakes up. Kate calls Philip (who had just been beaten up) and tells him to come home. Arriving at the mansion, he collapses and is taken to the hospital where he lies to Victor and Kate about what happened. Belle talks to Chloe at the hospital, and Chloe tells her lots of lies (Belle doesn't fall for it). Victor tries to discipline Philip for getting involved with the mob and lying by making him "Henderson's intern." Before watching the New Years fireworks with Craig, Chloe asks Nancy not to tell him that she is her daughter. 
At Dotcom, Philip tells Mimi, Jan and Jason how he saved a lady from a mugger. They see Chloe and make fun of her, calling her Morticia. Down a dark alley, Philip's bookie apologizes to him, saying he didn't know he was Victor's son. Chloe visits Nancy and sings her to sleep. Belle is also at the hospital worrying about Shawn. Chloe talks to her and cheers her up a bit. At school, Philip jokes about Shawn falling off the terrace, not realizing it was serious. Belle tells Philip and Mimi that she talked to Chloe at the hospital.
