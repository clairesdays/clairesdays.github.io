    <td id="maincontent-subpages"><H1>Old Shelle Edits</H1>
      <p>
Edits of Shawn and Belle (as portrayed by Jason Cook and Kirsten Storms). The edits contain all of Shawn's scenes and all of Belle's scenes, not just when they are together.
<p> 
The edits were made direct to DVD from my tapes. The tapes are mostly 1st generation original recordings - I try to specify when they aren't (whenever the picture quality varies, I show this in the screen captures). The DVDs are in NTSC format so can be played worldwide. They were made using the highest quality mode (except July 26th – August 17th 2001), so each DVD runs for about one hour.<p>
<p>
These are the original DVD Shelle edits that I have made. I have since made new replacement edits from original DVD recordings and so are slightly better quality than those listed on this page.
